This project has the Implementation of the algorithms mention in the paper "gCore: Exploring Cross-layer Cohesiveness in Multi-layer Graphs"
<br/>
Multilayered graphs are shown as per below :

<br/>
The above graph is called multiplex network(MPN) which is an example of pillar multi-layer graph

The above graph is called heterogeneous information network (HIN) which is an example of general multi-layer graph 
<br/>
Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of cohesive subgraph models and algorithms that can effectively handle a generic scenario involving relationships between both homogeneous entities and heterogeneous entities, i.e., on a general multi-layer graph (GMG)
<br/>
The implemented algorithm solves the above problem 


<br/>
Algorithm 1: 
<br/>
The algorithm include vertex peeling paradigm implemented in the class KPCoreAlgorithm that has been successfully used by the existing core search/decomposition algorithms which iteratively removes from ùê∫ùëô the vertices.

Algorithm 2:
<br/>
The algorithm include GCD+ algorithm implemented in the class KPPTreeAlgorithm for finding dense subgraphs in a multi-layered graph. The algorithm is based on the (k, p)-core decomposition, where k represents the minimum degree requirement, and p represents the minimum neighbor coverage fraction. The code includes classes for the graph, k-tree, and p-tree, as well as methods for depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the k-tree and p-tree.
