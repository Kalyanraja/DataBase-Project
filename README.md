This project has the Implementation of the algorithms mention in the paper "gCore: Exploring Cross-layer Cohesiveness in Multi-layer Graphs"
<br/>
Multilayered graphs are shown as per below : 
The algorithms include vertex peeling paradigm that has been successfully used by the existing core search/decomposition algorithms which iteratively removes from 𝐺𝑙 the vertices.
